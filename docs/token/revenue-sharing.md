# üí∞ Revenue Sharing Model

## Overview

PolyMarks will distribute a portion of Polymarket referral earnings to $POLYMARKS token holders.

## How We Earn Revenue

PolyMarks generates revenue through Polymarket's referral program:

1. User clicks "Trade on Polymarket" button on PolyMarks
2. User creates account or places trade on Polymarket
3. Polymarket pays PolyMarks a referral fee
4. PolyMarks distributes portion to qualifying token holders

## Eligibility Requirements

### Minimum Holding Requirement

**Hold 20,000,000+ $POLYMARKS tokens**

That's it. No tiers. No complexity. Just hold the minimum and qualify for revenue sharing.

### Snapshot Schedule
- Monthly snapshots on the **1st of each month**
- Must hold **20,000,000+ $POLYMARKS** at time of snapshot
- No lock-up period required
- No staking required

## Distribution Mechanism

### Monthly Payouts
1. **Revenue Collection:** All referral earnings for the month
2. **Revenue Pool:** Portion allocated to qualifying token holders
3. **Snapshot:** Check wallets holding 20M+ tokens
4. **Distribution:** Split equally among all qualifying wallets
5. **Payout:** Automatic airdrop

### Payment Currency
- **USDC** (Polygon network)
- Low gas fees
- Instant receipt

## Example Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Monthly referral revenue: $100,000
- Token holder allocation: 30% ‚Üí $30,000
- Qualifying wallets: 150 wallets (all holding 20M+ tokens)

**Your Share:**
```
Revenue pool = $30,000
Qualifying wallets = 150
Your payout = $30,000 / 150 = $200 USDC
```

**Simple Math:**
- More revenue = Higher payouts
- More qualifying holders = Split among more wallets
- All qualifying holders get equal share (no tiers)
