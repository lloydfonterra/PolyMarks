## 🏗️ Modular Architecture

Each feature is **isolated** in its own module:

```
features/
├── markets/                 # Market listing & display
├── whales/                  # Whale tracking
├── outliers/                # Smart money detection  
├── market-whale-sentiment/  # Market sentiment
├── wallet-tracker/          # Solana wallet tracking
└── referral/                # Polymarket referral system
```

**Each feature is self-contained** - edit one without breaking others!
